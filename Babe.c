	// I was thought by my baby.
	// A program is simply a sequence of instructions.
	// A compiler is a program used to translate a high level language to a low level language.
	// What is executing ? it is running a program.
	// What is an Intergrated Developers Enviroment- Software used for coding.
	// C was developed in 1972.
	// Feature of C: 
	// 1.portable.
	// 2.simple and Efficient.
	// 3.fast because it is a compiler based language.
	// 4.Popular.
	// 5.Uses libraries.
	// 6.Case sensitive.
	// 7.Uses dynamic language Supports the feature of DMA(Dynamic Memory Allocation)
	// 8. It is structured...Can bee broken down inro parts which can be run individually with help of functions.	
	
	// PROCEDURES OF CREATING PROGRAM USING C !

	
	// 1 The program is wrritten in the form of a number of text files using a sreen editor that is known as the source program.
	// 2 The machine code is executed with results.
	
	// APPLLICATONS OF C
	
	// 1 Used to develop OS such unix and linux.
	// 2 Used to develop embeeded sytems-systems implanted itnto a larger system.
	// 3 Used to develop other programming platforms.
	// 4 Used to develop google files sytems and google chrome browsers.
	// 5 Used to develop morzila firefox and Thunder bites.
	// 6 Used to develop database management systems.
	// 7 Used in compile and design.
	// 8 Used in gaming and animation.
	
	// C TOKENS
	
	//Tokens are what forms programs.
	//They are either key words identifiers constants literals or symbols.
	
	//THE C TOKENS:
	// ; - statement termminators
	// Comments-They are helping text
	// Identifiers- Are names used to identify variables - start with a letter or an _ 
	// Key words-Are reseved words which are already built into the system and can be applied during programming	
	// White space- Separates one part of a statement from another.
	
	//DATA TYPES
	
	//1.basic datatypes.
	//Intergers
	//floating
	//characters
	
	//2.Enumerated datatypes.
	//They are arithmetic and they define variables
	
	//3.The type void.
	//Indicates that no value is available
	
	//4. Derived types.
	
	
	
	return 0;
